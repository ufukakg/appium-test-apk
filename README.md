# appium-test-apk

This application was developed for our graduation project where we build a Appium-based software generates automated 
test cases for a given app. We used this simple Android application to crawl it and create a model of it. 
Currently, it includes around 14 UI components of Android such as Edittext, Datepicker, Timepicker, Button etc.
